<h2 class="title">SOUP.</h2>

<hr />

<p>"The best soups are made with a blending of
many flavors. Don't be afraid of experimenting
with them. Where you make one mistake you
will be surprised to find the number of successful
varieties you can produce. If you like a spicy
flavor try two or three cloves, or allspice, or bay
leaves. All soups are improved by a dash of onion,
unless it is the white soups, or pur&eacute;es from chicken,
veal, fish, etc. In these celery may be used. In
nothing as well as soups can a housekeeper be
economical of the odds and ends of food left from
meals. One of the best cooks was in the habit of
saving everything, and announced one day, when
her soup was especially praised, that it contained
the crumbs of gingerbread from her cake box!
Creamed onions left from a dinner, or a little stewed
corn, potatoes mashed, a few baked beans&mdash;even a
small dish of apple sauce have often added to the
flavor of soup. Of course, all good meat gravies,
or bones from roast or boiled meats, can be added
to your stock pot. A little butter is always needed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Page 4]</a></span>
in tomato soup. In making stock, use a quart of
water for every pound of meat and bone. Cut the
meat in pieces, crack the bones, place all in the
kettle, pour over it the proper quantity of cold
water; let it soak a while on the back of the range
before cooking. Let soup boil slowly, never hard,
(an hour for each pound of meat) strain through a
sieve or coarse cloth. Never let the fat remain on
your soup. Let get cold and lift it off, or skim it
off hot."</p>


<h3 class="recipe">BROWN STOCK.</h3>

<p class="h4">MRS. W. COOK.</p>

<p>Four pounds shin of beef, or other meats and
bones&mdash;four carrots, four onions, one turnip, one
small head of celery, one half tablespoonful of salt,
one half teaspoonful of peppercorns, six cloves, five
pints of cold water. Cut up the meat bone and
place it in a large saucepan, pour over the water,
skim when boiling, prepare the vegetables, add them
to the saucepan; cover closely and boil slowly four
hours. The spice should be added with the vegetables.</p>


<h3 class="recipe">CREAM OF CELERY SOUP.</h3>

<p class="h4">MRS. ERNEST F. WURTELE.</p>

<p>One quart chicken or veal broth; one quart milk;
one half cupful rice; one teaspoonful salt; one head
celery; seasoning. Use for this soup a quart of
chicken or veal broth and about a quart of milk;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Page 5]</a></span>
pick over and wash the rice, rinse it well in cold
water, and put it in a thick saucepan over the fire
with a pint of milk and a teaspoonful of salt; wash
a head of celery and grate the white stalks, letting
the grated celery fall into milk enough to cover it;
put the grated celery with the rice and gently simmer
them together until the rice is tender enough to
rub through a sieve with a potato masher, adding
more milk if the rice absorbs what has first been
put with it. After the rice has been rubbed
through the sieve, return it to the saucepan, place
it again over the fire, and gradually stir with it
the quart of stock or broth; if this quantity of
stock does not dilute the soup to a creamy consistency,
add a little milk; let the soup get scalding
hot, season it with salt, white pepper, and a very
little grated nutmeg, and serve at once.</p>

water, to keep the original quantity. Strain and
return to kettle, add one chopped onion, two grated
raw potatoes, one half small turnip grated, and one

them in a stewpan with a slice of butter, two or
three strips of bacon rind, which have been scalded
and scraped and two bay leaves. Put the lid on

are done, and then serve them on the same dish.
It is a great improvement some think, to parboil
the duck for fifteen minutes with an onion in the
water, and the strong fishy flavor that is sometimes
so disagreeable in wild ducks will have disappeared.
A carrot will answer the same purpose.</p>


<h3 class="recipe">ROAST QUAIL WITH BREAD SAUCE.</h3>

<p>Peel and slice an onion and put it over the fire
in a pint of milk; pluck and singe half a dozen
quail, draw them without breaking the intestines,
cut off the heads and feet, and wipe them with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Page 31]</a></span>
wet towel; rub them all over with butter; season
them with pepper and salt, and roast them before
a very hot fire for fifteen minutes basting them
three or four times with butter. Have some slices
of toast laid under them to catch the drippings.
While the birds are roasting make a bread sauce
as follows; roll a pint bowlfull of dry bread, and sift
the crumbs; use the finest ones for the sauce, and
the largest for the frying later; remove the onion
from the milk in which it has been boiling, stir
into the milk the finest portion of the crumbs,
season it with a saltspoonful of white pepper and a
grate of nutmeg, stir in a tablespoonful of butter,
and stir the sauce until it is smooth; then place
the saucepan containing it in a pan of boiling
water to keep it hot; put two tablespoonfuls of
butter over the fire in a frying pan, and when it is
smoking hot put into it the coarse half of the
crumbs, dust them with cayenne pepper, and stir
them until they are light brown; then at once put
them on a hot dish; put the bread sauce into a
gravy-boat ready to send it to the table. Arrange
to have the fried breadcrumbs, sauce and quail done
at the same time; serve the birds on the toast
which has been laid under them; in serving the
quail, lay each bird on a hot plate, pour over it a
large spoonful of the bread sauce and on that place
a spoonful of the fried bread crumbs.</p>

<h2 class="title">VEGETABLES.</h2>

<hr />

<p class="cooks">"Cheerful cooks make every dish a feast."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Massinger.</span></p>

<hr />

<p>Always have the water boiling when you put
your vegetables in, and keep it constantly boiling
until they are done. Cook each kind by itself
when convenient. All vegetables should be well
seasoned.</p>


<h3 class="recipe">APPLES.</h3>

<p class="h4">MRS. DAVID BELL.</p>

<p>When the barrel of apples you have bought,
begins to make your mind uneasy, because they can
spoil faster than you can use them, a good plan is
to peel, core and stir them with a very little sugar
and screw them down in your jam jars. They will
keep for a couple of months and will be handy to
fill a tart or as apple sauce, etc.; they do not need
to be cooked too much and some of the firmer sorts
may remain in quarters solid enough for a pie.
Another plan is to peel but not core the suspicious
ones, then let them freeze solid, when frozen pack
them in a box and cover. Keep them where they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Page 35]</a></span>
will not thaw. When you wish for a dish of baked
apples, put them in your baking pan, scatter a little
sugar over them and put them in a quick oven
without letting them thaw, when done, they should
each be whole and a pretty brown color.</p>


<h3 class="recipe">BEANS.</h3>

<p>Beans are a nice winter vegetable, but cooked
with pork as "baked beans," are too strong for
daily use, but are a desirable article of food cooked
more plainly. Choose the small white beans, put
them in a saucepan with as much cold water, as
will cover them well and a small pinch of baking
soda; when they have simmered a few minutes
drain off the water and replace it with hot water
and a little salt; if possible let them cook without
boiling hard; when tender drain, and dish with a
liberal piece of butter and a dust of pepper. They
are also good thrown when drained into the frying
pan with some dripping, pepper and salt, and heated
a few minutes over the fire. The only attention
they require in cooking is lest they melt into soup
when nearly cooked.</p>


<h3 class="recipe">FRIED BEETS.</h3>

in the crust while it is an exceedingly good
dish for a dinner course or for lunch or tea. When
the pudding is hard, it can be rolled in the egg and
bread crumbs. The moment the egg touches the
hot lard it hardens and secures the pudding which
softens to a creamy substance very delicious. Ingredients,
one pint of milk, five ounces of sugar
(little more than half a cupful,) butter the size of a
hickory nut, yolks of three eggs, two tablespoonfuls
of corn starch, and one tablespoonful of flour,
(a generous half cupful altogether), stick of cinnamon
one inch long, one half teaspoonful of
vanilla. Put the cinnamon into the milk and
when it is just about to boil, stir in the sugar,
cornstarch and flour, the two latter rubbed smooth
with two or three tablespoons of extra cold milk:
stir it over the fire for fully two minutes, to cook
well the starch and flour; take it from the fire,
stir in the beaten yolks of the eggs and return it
a few minutes to set them; now again taking it
from the fire remove the cinnamon, stir in the
butter and vanilla and pour it on a buttered platter
until one third of an inch high. When cold
and stiff cut the pudding into parallelograms,
about three inches long and two inches wide: roll
them carefully, first in sifted cracker crumbs then
in eggs (slightly beaten and sweetened) then again
in cracker-crumbs. Dip these into boiling hot lard
(a wire basket should be used if convenient) and
when of fine color, take them out and place them
in the oven for four or five minutes to better soften
the pudding. Sprinkle over pulverized sugar and
serve immediately.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Page 78]</a></span></p>

<p class="cakes">
"With weights and measures just and true,<br />
<span class="cakes">Oven of even heat,<br /></span>
Well buttered tins and quiet nerves,<br />
<span class="cakes">Success will be complete."</span></p>

<hr />

<p>"In making cake, the ingredients should be of
the first quality&mdash;the flour super-fine, and always
sifted; the butter fresh and sweet and not too much
salted. Coffee A, or granulated sugar is best for
cakes. Much care should be taken in breaking
and separating the eggs, and equal care taken as
regards their freshness. Break each egg separately in
a teacup; then into the vessels in which they are
to be beaten. Never use an egg when the white
is the least discolored. Before beating the whites
remove every particle of yolk. If any is allowed
to remain, it will prevent them becoming as stiff
and dry as required. Deep earthen bowls are best
for mixing cake, and a wooden spoon or paddle is
best for beating batter. Before commencing to
make your cake, see that all the ingredients required
are at hand. By so doing the work may be
done in much less time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Page 99]</a></span></p>

<p>"The lightness of a cake depends not only upon
the making, but the baking also. It is highly
important to exercise judgment respecting the heat
of the oven, which must be regulated according to
the cake you bake, and the stove you use. Solid
cake requires sufficient heat to cause it to rise and
brown nicely without scorching. If it should
brown too fast cover with thick brown paper. All
light cakes require quick heat and are not good
if baked in a cool oven. Those having molasses
as an ingredient scorch more quickly, consequently
should be baked in a moderate oven. Every cook
should use her own judgment, and by frequent
baking she will in a very short time be able to tell
by the appearance of either bread or cake whether
it is sufficiently done."</p>

<h3 class="recipe">CANNING FRUIT.</h3>

<p class="h4">MISS M. SAMPSON.</p>

<p>To can strawberries, raspberries or plums: to each
pound of sugar add one half pint of water, boil till
you have a rich syrup, let stand till cold; have your
jars packed full of raw fruit (not crushed) and fill
with the cold syrup, put on the covers and screws,
(not the rubber rings,) and place in cold water up
to the neck of the jars, you will need straw or chips
between the jars to prevent them touching each
other or burning on the bottom, let the water boil
for fifteen minutes, have some hot syrup to fill jars,
put on rubber rings, screw up tightly and keep in
a cool dark place.</p>


<h3 class="recipe">CANNED FRUIT JUICES.</h3>

<p class="h4">MRS. FARQUHARSON SMITH.</p>

<p>Fruit juice may be kept for a long time by canning
the same as whole fruit. They are convenient<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Page 135]</a></span>
for water ices and summer beverages. Mash the
fruit and rub the pulp through a fine sieve. Mix
about three pounds of sugar with one quart of fruit
juice and pulp. Fill Mason's jars with the syrup,
cover and place in a heater with cold water to cover
nearly to the top of the jar. Let the water boil
half an hour, then fill each jar to the brim, seal
and cool in the water.</p>


<h3 class="recipe">TO BRANDY PEACHES.</h3>

<p>To three pounds of sugar add a pint and a half
water; boil and skim it; prepare eight pounds of
ripe clingstone peaches: wash and rub with a coarse
towel until all the down is off, then pierce them
with a fork and throw them into the syrup and
boil them until a sharp straw can punctuate them:
as they soften put them into your jar, which must
be kept closely covered. Boil your syrup until it
thickens, while hot, add a quart of the best brandy
and throw it over your peaches, tie the jar down
closely.</p>


<h3 class="recipe">CURRANT JELLY.</h3>

<p>Currants should not be over ripe. Equal parts of
red and white currants or currants and raspberries
make a delicately colored and flavored jelly. Pick
over and remove the leaves and poor fruit, and if
filthy wash and drain them but do not stem them.
Mash them in a porcelain kettle, with wooden
pestle without heating as that makes the jelly dark.
Let them drain in a flannel bag over night. <i>Do not</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Page 136]</a></span>
squeeze them, or the jelly will be cloudy. In the
morning measure a bowl of sugar for each bowl of
juice, and heat the sugar carefully in an earthern
dish in the oven. Stir it often to prevent burning:
boil the juice twenty minutes and skim thoroughly.
Add the hot sugar and boil from three to five
minutes or till it thickens on a spoon when exposed
to the air. Turn at once into glasses and let them
remain in the sun several days then cover with
paper dipped in brandy and paste paper over the
tops of the glasses. One who is authority on this
subject recommends covering with melted paraffine,
or putting a lump of paraffine in the jelly
while still hot. After draining the juice, the currants
may be squeezed and a second quality of jelly
made, it may not be clear but will answer for some
purposes.</p>


<h3 class="recipe">CANDIED PEEL.</h3>

<p class="h4">MRS. DAVID BELL.</p>

<p>Put the lemon or orange skins, in strong salt
and water, when they are soft enough to pass
a straw through, take them out and soak them
changing the water till all the salt taste is gone, then
simmer them in thin brown sugar syrup till clear;
take them out, place on a dish, and let them remain
for a day or two. Boil the syrup till thick, then
fill the skins with it and put away to dry.</p>


<h3 class="recipe">LEMON HONEY. (Filling.)</h3>

<p class="h4">MRS. FRANK GLASS.</p>

<p>One pound of butter, four pounds of sugar, two
dozen eggs leaving out eight whites, rind and juice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Page 137]</a></span>

simmer until it thickens like honey. Put into jars,
can be kept for years.</p>


<h3 class="recipe">PUMPKIN JAM.</h3>

<p class="h4">MRS. HENRY THOMSON.</p>

<p>Peel and seed, then, cut into pieces two or
three inches square, lay on a dish to dry till next
day, then put into the preserving pan and barely
cover with molasses. To a medium sized pumpkin
put one ounce cloves and about a dessertspoon of
ginger or as much as will taste; let it boil until the
pumpkin is quite soft. One half dozen apples (sour)
just cored not peeled is a great improvement. The
molasses must only come to the top of your pieces,
not nearly cover them.</p>


<h3 class="recipe">FRUIT JELLY.</h3>

<p class="h4">MRS. DUNCAN LAURIE.</p>

<p>Dissolve two ounces of tartaric acid in one quart
of cold water, pour it on to five pounds of strawberries,
currants, or raspberries. Let it stand twenty-four
hours. Then strain it without pressing or
bruising the fruit. To every pint of clear juice add
one and one half pounds of white sugar. Stir frequently
till the sugar is dissolved. Then bottle
and cork air tight. Keep in a cool, dark place.
When required for use dissolve one ounce gelatine
in one half pint boiling water, add one and one half
pints syrup. Pour in a mould and set away to
stiffen. Serve with whipped cream.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Page 138]</a></span></p>

the skin and seeds from the pulp and mix peel
and pulp together and weigh them. For every
pound of fruit, pour three pints of cold water over
it and let stand twenty four hours. Boil till chips
are tender (about an hour and a half). This absorbs
a great deal of the fluid. Let it stand another
twenty-four hours. To every pound of boiled fruit,
put one and one quarter pounds of sugar. Boil till
syrup jellies, and chips are transparent. Boil pippins
and skins in a gallon of water, and strain.</p>

water, let stand for twenty-four hours, boil till quite
tender putting the pips in a muslin bag when ready:
to every pound of fruit add one and one half
pounds white sugar and boil till it jellies, from
twenty to thirty minutes.</p>

<p class="h4">MRS. W. W. HENRY.</p>

<p>Seven pounds of currants, six pounds of sugar,
two pounds of raisins, two oranges. Cook one and
one half hours. Strain out the juice of currants,
seed the raisins, and chop fine. Use all of the
orange but the seeds, chop fine.</p>

<p class="h4">MRS. THEOPHILUS OLIVER.</p>

<p>Peel and cut the rhubarb into small pieces, take
the rind of one lemon, cut into chips; to each two
pounds of the rhubarb then weigh three quarters of
a pound of white sugar to each pound of the fruit.
Put the fruit and sugar in a basin in layers and let
it stand all night. Pour off the syrup and boil it
for twenty minutes, add the fruit and boil for
twenty minutes more, when the marmalade should
be ready to put in pots.</p>


<h3 class="recipe">PRESERVED RAW PINEAPPLE.</h3>

<p class="h4">MRS. W. COOK.</p>

<p>Pare the pineapples and take out all the eyes. With
a sharp knife, cut the pineapple in thin slices cutting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Page 140]</a></span>
down sides until the heart is reached, this is to be
discarded. Weigh the sliced pineapple and put in
a large earthen dish. Add to it as many pounds
of granulated sugar as there are pounds of fruit
and stir well. Pack this mixture in quart or
pint jars: cover tightly and put away. The pineapple
will keep a year or more and be perfectly
tender and fine flavored. It is best to choose fruit
not over ripe.</p>

add them to the milk and beat in the flour; the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Page 152]</a></span>
mixture ought to be the consistency of good custard.

<p>One pint of flour, one cup of sour cream, one
small teaspoon soda, three eggs.</p>


<h3 class="recipe">SHORTBREAD.</h3>

<p class="h4">MRS. W. REID.</p>

<p>Place on a bake-board two pounds of sifted flour,
one pound butter (if salt, wash,) and half a pound<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Page 153]</a></span>
of sugar; this quantity will make four cakes.
Knead all altogether and when well mixed form

sugar, eight ounces sifted flour, eight ounces good
butter. The yolks of eight eggs, about eight drops
of essence of ratafia. First see that the ground
almonds are fresh. Mix them with the flour and
sugar and then very, very carefully add a few drops
of ratafia. Mix everything thoroughly. Make a
space in centre, and in this drop the yolks of the
eggs. Then melt the butter, add that and mix up
the whole together until it is a nice firm stiff paste.
This should now be rolled a great many times; cannot
be rolled too much. When sufficiently rolled
to appear like a strip of cream coloured satin a
quarter of an inch thick, cut in small squares with
a sharp knife. Pinch the edges of each square and
in centre of each cake, put a split half of blanched
almond. Butter baking tins and bake in a moderate
oven to a fine pale yellow tint. These are delicious
and are particularly good in summer eaten
with fruit.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Page 154]</a></span></p>


<h3 class="recipe">SCOTCH SHORT BREAD.</h3>

<p class="h4">MRS. BLAIR.</p>

<p>One pound of flour, one half pound butter, six
ounces sugar; cream butter and sugar, add flour.
Roll into a smooth ball and work down until half
an inch in thickness, an operation which is rather
difficult for a novice, as it is apt to crack at the
edges; but the knack is soon learned, and the
more it is worked the better. Prick with a small
skewer, strew with large carraway comfits, and
bake slowly, a pale brown.</p>

<h3 class="recipe">FRENCH PANCAKES.</h3>

<p class="h4">MRS. BENSON BENNETT.</p>

<p>Four eggs, weight of four eggs in butter, sugar and
flour, one half a teaspoonful of soda, one half teaspoonful
of cream of tartar. As much milk as will
make a batter. Beat the butter and sugar to a
cream, add the four eggs well beaten stir in all the
other ingredients. Bake in tin plates.</p>

<hr class="haggis" />

<h3 class="recipe">SCOTCH HAGGIS.</h3>

<p class="h4">MRS. ANDREW T. LOVE.</p>

<p>Boil a sheep's draught for three quarters of an
hour in as much water as will cover it. Grate
down the liver and mince the heart and lights
very fine. Mince two pounds of onions, and two
pounds of beef suet, put in three or four handsful
of oatmeal with pepper and salt to taste. Having
these ingredients very well mixed, put them into
the bag with a little of the boilings of the draught.
Pick the bag well to prevent its bursting. It requires
from three to four hours boiling, so if you
make it a day or two before you intend using it,
it is better to boil it two hours after it is
made, and two hours when going to use it. Great
care must be taken in having the bag very particularly
scraped and cleansed by frequent washings
in salt and water. The liver and heart, etc.,
are better, to be boiled before, then they can be
grated down easily. Half of this receipt makes
a very good sized Haggis.</p>

<p>Shirt, Collars and Cuffs Laundered in the newest style of finish.
"The DOMESTIC FINISH." No high gloss to look like Celluloid or
Paper Collars, but a nice medium finish that has all the appearance of
new work. High gloss finish is all out of style. Gentlemen these times
always ask for the "Domestic Finish." We have equipped ourselves
with the latest machines for this high grade of work.</p>

<p>KID GLOVES cleaned by a new process, giving them the same soft
finish as new kid. Try us and be convinced.</p>

<p>FALL IS APPROACHING&mdash;Our Dyeing Departments are equipped
in the same manner as the Laundry, with all the latest and most
up-to-date machinery and appliances for the handling of all grades of
work, from the most delicate fabrics to the heaviest and coarsest material.
Fine Lace, Ladies Dresses, Gents' Suits, Curtains, Portieres, Rugs,
etc. CARPETS CLEANED in a superior manner; all moths removed by
our process of cleaning.</p>
